Welcome to my home page!

I am an INRIA Junior Researcher (chargée de recherche) in the [SODA](https://team.inria.fr/soda/) team at INRIA Saclay.
My main research area is Machine Learning, and in particular learning with incomplete data.
I am a science enthusiast, interested in the application of Machine Learning in various
scientific domains as well as in the health domain.

Until October 2021, I was a postdoctoral researcher in the Parietal team at INRIA.
I worked on supervised learning with missing values, with [Gaël Varoquaux](http://gael-varoquaux.info), [Julie Josse](http://juliejosse.com) and [Erwan Scornet](https://erwanscornet.github.io/).

I did my PhD at Mines ParisTech and Institut Curie under the supervision of [Jean-Philippe Vert](http://members.cbio.mines-paristech.fr/~jvert/) and [Andrei Zinovyev](https://auranic.github.io/). My PhD aimed at developing new representations and efficient algorithms for machine learning on genomic data.

Here is a [short CV](/files/CV_short.pdf).
