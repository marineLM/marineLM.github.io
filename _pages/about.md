Welcome to my homepage!

I am an INRIA Researcher (Chargée de Recherche) in Machine Learning in the [SODA](https://team.inria.fr/soda/) team.
My research addresses the challenge of learning with incomplete data, a challenging and pervasive issue across fields like healthcare and social sciences. My research also foucses on model auditing to ensure trust and reliability in machine learning systems. I’m passionate about harnessing the power of AI to solve complex problems, particularly in scientific fields and healthcare.

Until October 2021, I was a postdoctoral researcher in the Parietal team at INRIA
where I worked on supervised learning with missing values, with [Gaël Varoquaux](http://gael-varoquaux.info), [Julie Josse](http://juliejosse.com) and [Erwan Scornet](https://erwanscornet.github.io/).

I completed my PhD at Mines ParisTech and Institut Curie under the supervision of [Jean-Philippe Vert](http://members.cbio.mines-paristech.fr/~jvert/) and [Andrei Zinovyev](https://auranic.github.io/). My doctoral work aimed at developing new representations and efficient algorithms for machine learning on genomic data.

Feel free to get in touch if you’d like to discuss research, collaborations, or simply share ideas. 

Here is a [brief CV](/files/CV_short.pdf).
