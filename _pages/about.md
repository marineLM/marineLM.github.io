Welcome to my homepage!

<!--I'm a Research Scientist (Chargée de Recherche) in Machine Learning at INRIA, within the SODA team. I am interested in statistical learning. In particular, my studies focus on tabular foundation models, which offer  new opportunities thanks to large scale pretraining. I also focus on model auditing to enhance trust and reliability in machine learning models. I am also an expert in learning from incomplete data, a common issue affecting fields like healthcare and social sciences.  I'm passionate about leveraging AI to solve complex problems, particularly in sciences and healthcare.-->

I am a Research Scientist (Chargée de Recherche) in Machine Learning at INRIA, within the [SODA](https://team.inria.fr/soda/) team. My research lies at the intersection of statistical learning and trustworthy AI, with a focus on:

* Tabular foundation models, which unlock new possibilities through large-scale pretraining.
* Model auditing, to enhance the trustworthiness and reliability of machine learning systems.
* Learning from incomplete data, a challenge pervasive in fields like healthcare and social sciences.


I am passionate about using AI to tackle complex scientific and healthcare problems, ensuring that machine learning models are both powerful and reliable.

<!-- Until October 2021, I was a postdoctoral researcher in the Parietal team at INRIA
where I worked on supervised learning with missing values, with [Gaël Varoquaux](http://gael-varoquaux.info), [Julie Josse](http://juliejosse.com) and [Erwan Scornet](https://erwanscornet.github.io/).-->

<!--  I completed my PhD at Mines ParisTech and Institut Curie under the supervision of [Jean-Philippe Vert](http://members.cbio.mines-paristech.fr/~jvert/) and [Andrei Zinovyev](https://auranic.github.io/). My doctoral work aimed at developing new representations and efficient algorithms for machine learning on genomic data.-->

Feel free to get in touch if you’d like to discuss research, collaborations, or simply share ideas.
