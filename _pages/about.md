Welcome to my homepage!

I'm a Research Scientist (Chargée de Recherche) in Machine Learning at INRIA, within the SODA team. My work tackes learning from incomplete data, a common issue affecting fields like healthcare and social sciences. I also focus on model auditing to enhance trust and reliability in machine learning models. I'm passionate about leveraging AI to solve complex problems, particularly in sciences and healthcare.

Until October 2021, I was a postdoctoral researcher in the Parietal team at INRIA
where I worked on supervised learning with missing values, with [Gaël Varoquaux](http://gael-varoquaux.info), [Julie Josse](http://juliejosse.com) and [Erwan Scornet](https://erwanscornet.github.io/).

I completed my PhD at Mines ParisTech and Institut Curie under the supervision of [Jean-Philippe Vert](http://members.cbio.mines-paristech.fr/~jvert/) and [Andrei Zinovyev](https://auranic.github.io/). My doctoral work aimed at developing new representations and efficient algorithms for machine learning on genomic data.

Feel free to get in touch if you’d like to discuss research, collaborations, or simply share ideas. 

Here is a [brief CV](/files/CV_short.pdf).
